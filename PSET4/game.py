# prompt the user for a level 'n'. 
#   if the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
# randomly generates an integer between 1 and 'n', inclusive, using 'random' module
# random module from docs.python.org/3/library/random.html.
# prompt the user to guess that integer
#   if the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again
#       if the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output 'Too small!' and prompt the user again
#       if the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output 'Too large!' and prompt the user again
#       if the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output 'Just right!' and exit.
